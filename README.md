## Commands

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

### Adding a dependency with `sv`

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
pnpm dlx sv add <drizzle-or-smth>
```
